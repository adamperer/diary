# Talk at PITT's DBMI

I gave a seminar in the University of Pittsburgh's Department of Biomedical Informatics (http://www.dbmi.pitt.edu/node/1946).  There was a lot of interest in our cohort construction tools (COQUITO) and the ability to visualize cohorts in general, in order to speed up the research pipeline.  Implied a lot of their data is stored using i2b2's data models, and would be great if we could easily import such a data model into our tools to make them more accessible.

Related to our predictive modeling work, interesting questions were raised regarding causality issues with predictive models when I showed how Prospector could be potentially used to address actionable features.  For instance, just because a feature is highly predictive (e.g. a treatment associated with a disease), it doesn't mean the treatment causes the disease.  An open research questions exist on how to discern which features are actionable and which are not, so the interaction with models isn't misleading.
