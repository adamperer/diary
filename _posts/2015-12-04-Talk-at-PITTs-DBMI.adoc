# Talk at PITT's DBMI

I gave a seminar in the [University of Pittsburgh's Department of Biomedical Informatics](http://www.dbmi.pitt.edu/node/1946).  There was a lot of interest in our cohort construction tools (COQUITO) and the ability to visualize cohorts in general, in order to speed up the research pipeline.  Implied a lot of their data is stored using i2b2's data models, and would be great if we could easily import such a data model into our tools to make them more accessible.
